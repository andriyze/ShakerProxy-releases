# Network planning and transactional safety

The current source implements read-only host discovery, strict plan validation,
deterministic preview, durable staging, and a production-host-gated guarded
apply. The development profile and source installer do not activate networking.

## Validation boundary

Plans use schema version 1 and reject unknown JSON fields. Validation checks
topology roles, interface-name safety, stable host identity, VLAN combinations,
active-SSH preservation, IPv4 subnet and DHCP semantics, reserved addresses,
existing host-prefix overlap, the explicit IPv6 strategy and lab prefix (see
[IPv6 in the lab](ipv6.md)), and unsupported IPv6-only routing. The WAN model
separately represents keep-existing, DHCP, or static
IPv4; keep-existing, SLAAC, DHCPv6-address, static, or no managed IPv6;
DHCP-DNS handling; upstream NAT; VLAN tags; and optional WAN/lab MTU. Prefix
delegation, bootstrap-only DNS, MSS clamping, and PPPoE are visible but fail
closed or remain disabled until their packet paths exist. A valid plan receives
a SHA-256 hash over its canonical typed JSON.

Preview revalidates against the current host and renders:

- `/etc/netplan/90-shakerproxy.yaml`, containing the selected lab address and any
  explicitly reviewed VLAN/WAN settings. `KEEP_EXISTING` is the default and
  emits no WAN stanza, preserving existing addressing, routes, MTU, and DNS
  ownership.
- `/etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf`, containing the bounded lease pool, lifetime, DNS
  options, search domain, and deterministic reservations.
- Dedicated `SHAKERPROXY-FORWARD` and optional `SHAKERPROXY-POSTROUTING` chains.
- `firewall_restore_ipv6`: the ip6tables chains for the IPv6 strategy (a lab
  drop chain for `DISABLED`; forward, input, and ULA-only NAT66 chains for a
  routed lab prefix).
- `radvd_conf`: the router advertisement configuration for a routed lab
  prefix, written to `/etc/shakerproxy/radvd/shakerproxy.conf`.
- Fixed argument-array commands that check before attaching those chains to
  `DOCKER-USER` (IPv6: Docker's IPv6 `DOCKER-USER`, or `FORWARD` when Docker
  does not manage ip6tables), `INPUT`, and `POSTROUTING`.
- Human-readable impact and an exact changed-object list.

The host inspection uses only fixed, allowlisted command paths and arguments. It
detects iptables nft/legacy mode, Docker's configured firewall backend and daemon
availability, `DOCKER-USER`, UFW, firewalld, whether the kernel has IPv6, and
the ip6tables ruleset (Docker's IPv6 hook and any stale ShakerProxy IPv6 chains,
which block apply like the IPv4 chains). That complete observation is
embedded in every preview and durable stage. A plan may still be reviewed when
the environment is not apply-ready, but its impact explicitly says apply is
blocked. Unreadable UFW configuration and an indeterminate firewalld state are
blocking unknowns rather than being treated as inactive.

Host preflight marks the interface carrying each kernel default route and
reports bounded Netplan filenames plus likely cloud-init ownership. If a plan
would change a working WAN, the administrator must explicitly acknowledge that
exact risk. A likely cloud-init override requires a second acknowledgement.
Neither acknowledgement permits changing the interface used by the current
SSH session; that remains a hard rejection. Validation and commit both repeat
this host-aware decision, and static addresses/gateways are typed before they
can reach YAML rendering.

The browser offers a template for every topology, each with a live role
diagram: two ports (`TWO_NIC`), one port (`SINGLE_ARM`), WAN, lab and
management (`THREE_INTERFACE`), a single-NIC VLAN trunk (`VLAN_TRUNK`), an
existing routed VLAN (`EXISTING_ROUTED_VLAN`), a passive mirror or TAP
(`PASSIVE_SENSOR`), an advanced routed plan (`ADVANCED_CUSTOM`), and the inline
bridge between a device and the router (`TRANSPARENT_BRIDGE`). What each one
lets ShakerProxy see is in the
[protocol matrix](protocol-support.md#routing-modes).

Single-arm uses one existing IPv4 interface for both WAN and lab traffic. It
preserves that interface's address, route, DNS ownership, VLAN, and MTU;
requires NAT44; disables ICMP redirects transactionally, both the
interface's and `net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects` (the kernel sends redirects
while either is on), and drops any that still leave the interface with the
owned `SHAKERPROXY-OUTPUT` chain; and never starts ShakerProxy DHCP. Each test client must be configured manually with the ShakerProxy
address as its IPv4 gateway and DNS server. Same-subnet client isolation is not
possible, and client IPv6 must be disabled or separately isolated to prevent a
bypass. Dual-NIC remains the preferred production topology.

Every lab stanza (the lab NIC or VLAN, the Wi-Fi access point, `lgbr0` and its
wired port) renders `dhcp4: false`. Netplan merges all files that define an
interface and keeps the keys a later file leaves out, so without it a DHCP
client that cloud-init or the installer enabled on the lab NIC would keep
running there, and a device under test could give the host a default route.
An existing plan gets this the next time it is applied.

For dual-NIC, three-interface, existing-routed-VLAN, and VLAN-trunk plans, the
default `DISABLED` strategy persistently renders `dhcp6: false`,
`accept-ra: false`, and `link-local: []` on the ShakerProxy lab interface and
loads an ip6tables chain that drops every forwarded IPv6 packet entering or
leaving the lab. This prevents the sensor from acquiring, advertising, or
forwarding an IPv6 path on that segment; the isolated test network must not
provide a second router. `OBSERVE_ONLY` keeps the same no-address/no-route
boundary without IPv6 firewall changes while allowing raw capture to see IPv6
frames. `ULA_NAT66_LAB` and `NATIVE_ROUTED_PREFIX` give the lab a /64 with
SLAAC and RDNSS from `shakerproxy-radvd`, enable IPv6 forwarding, and load IPv6
chains that mirror the IPv4 ones (NAT66 only for ULA); see
[IPv6 in the lab](ipv6.md). Prefix delegation is rejected at validation with
the alternatives. Single-arm and passive plans cannot route IPv6. Passive
interfaces receive no IPv4 or IPv6 address configuration.

The inline bridge (`TRANSPARENT_BRIDGE`) puts ShakerProxy between test
devices and the router as a bridge over two ports, with spanning tree on and no
DHCP, NAT or routing of its own: devices keep the router's addressing and need
no setup. See [Inline bridge](bridge-mode.md). One-NIC VLAN plans derive two
validated subinterfaces from the same stable physical identity and render owned
`vlans` entries. Passive sensor plans contain no WAN, routing, NAT, or DHCP
mutation; this release does not record their mirror port yet, because
recording needs a lab interface.

## What lab devices can reach on ShakerProxy

When the lab has its own port, VLAN or Wi-Fi network (two-NIC,
three-interface, VLAN and Wi-Fi labs), the devices under test reach only what
they need on ShakerProxy's lab address:

- DHCP, ping and IPv6 neighbor discovery;
- DNS sent to ShakerProxy, and the HTTPS and CA page (`http://<lab gateway>/`)
  the traffic policy redirects to ShakerProxy's own listeners;
- the [network-gear syslog collector](network-gear-logs.md) (ports 1514 and
  514), which accepts only the sources its allowlist names.

Everything else a lab device sends to the host is dropped: SSH, the
management ports and any other service listening on every address, as for
[VPN devices](vpn-mode.md#what-vpn-devices-can-reach). Replies to connections
the host itself opens still arrive, and the lab recording still shows every
attempt. The rules live in the traffic policy's `SHAKERPROXY-SEC-INPUT` chain
and follow the confirmed plan: they hold in every policy state (observe-only,
Fleet-managed, emergency bypass) and go when the lab is turned off or rolled
back. Single-arm and inline-bridge labs share ShakerProxy's address with its
own traffic and management, so they are not restricted. Manage ShakerProxy
from the WAN side, for example over `ssh -L 8443:127.0.0.1:8443`.

## Wi-Fi access point

A plan can include a `wifi` object and one interface with the `WIFI_AP` role so
ShakerProxy broadcasts the lab network itself; see the
[Wi-Fi access point guide](wifi-access-point.md). With `TWO_NIC`,
`THREE_INTERFACE`, `EXISTING_ROUTED_VLAN`, or `ADVANCED_CUSTOM` topologies the
access point is either the whole lab segment or, with `bridge_with_lab`, joins
the wired `LAB` port in bridge `lgbr0`. The effective lab interface (the
adapter or `lgbr0`) then carries the lab address, Kea DHCPv4, the
`SHAKERPROXY-FORWARD` rules, capture, and traffic policy. In a
`TRANSPARENT_BRIDGE` plan the access point instead joins the inline bridge as a
second device port, and Wi-Fi devices get their addresses from the router (see
[Wi-Fi on the bridge](bridge-mode.md#wi-fi-on-the-bridge)). Preview adds
`hostapd_conf` with the password redacted. Preflight reports `wireless`,
`ap_supported`, and `wireless_bands` per interface, and validation rejects a
missing `hostapd`, a non-wireless adapter, or an adapter without AP mode.

Apply writes `/etc/shakerproxy/hostapd/shakerproxy.conf` (0600, root) before touching
Netplan, restarts `shakerproxy-hostapd.service` after the firewall is attached,
waits for the adapter to come up, and only then starts DHCP. A `WIFI_AP` health
check verifies the service, adapter state, and bridge membership. Confirmation
enables the unit for boot; every rollback path stops and disables it and
restores the previous configuration file.

## Firewall coexistence proof

`tests/netlab/run.sh` (two-NIC) and `tests/netlab/single-arm.sh` apply a plan
in isolated Linux network namespaces with gatewayd's own transaction:
preview, staging, commit with the management heartbeat, the rollback
snapshot, the native syntax checks, the independent watchdog, the applier and
the health checks. The gateway namespace holds synthetic Docker and
administrator chains (Docker's FORWARD policy is DROP in the routed lab, so
lab traffic passes only through ShakerProxy's rules). After the confirmed
plan is reverted, and after the watchdog rolls back a change nobody
confirmed, every rule that is not ShakerProxy's is exactly as before (packet
counters and generated comments left out), the plan's chains are gone and
forwarding and both `send_redirects` values are restored. The routed proof
also simulates a reboot: with the plan's chains and forwarding gone and the
traffic policy's hook attached first, gatewayd's runtime keeper restores the
plan directly below that hook, once, and restoring again duplicates nothing.
The clean Ubuntu VM confirm scenario additionally restarts a real Docker
daemon after apply and verifies that the ShakerProxy hook and chains survive
exactly once.

## Staging contract

Staging requires the preview hash, an idempotency key, and a 60–900 second TTL.
It repeats live validation and refuses a changed hash. Identical retries return
the same apply ID. A different request cannot replace an unexpired stage.
Staged state is atomically persisted and survives daemon restart with status
`STAGED_NOT_APPLIED`. Exact rollback removes it without touching the host.

## Guarded transaction lifecycle

The internal lifecycle is persisted as strict phases: `PREPARING`,
`WATCHDOG_ARMED`, `APPLYING`, `AWAITING_HEALTH`,
`AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`, `CONFIRMED`, and the rollback phases. Apply cannot
begin before a 60–900 second watchdog deadline is armed. Management, WAN, DNS,
and IPv4-forwarding checks must all pass. The DHCPv4 lab-link/service check must
also pass for managed-DHCP topologies and is explicitly skipped for single-arm
and passive modes; IPv6 may be skipped only when the plan does not enable it.
Failed health, an expired deadline, and explicit failure all converge on
`ROLLBACK_REQUIRED`.

The watchdog contract stores an immutable, size-bounded, strict-JSON manifest
under a directory derived from the daemon-generated apply ID. Confirmation is
hash-bound, deadline-bound, atomic, durable, and idempotent. The launcher uses a
fixed `systemd-run` executable and property/argument array; callers cannot
supply unit names, commands, paths, or shell text.

The separate watchdog executable now has a first-apply rollback executor. Its
manifest records the prior owned Netplan and Kea configuration digests/modes,
the exact approved iptables executable, the prior IPv4-forwarding bit, and—when
single-arm is selected—the prior per-interface and `conf/all` ICMP-redirect
bits.
Before any rollback command it verifies the backup digests. It then attempts
every independent recovery step: stop and disable the ShakerProxy DHCP service,
remove only exact ShakerProxy hooks/chains, restore the two managed configuration
files, reload Netplan through fixed commands, restore `net.ipv4.ip_forward`,
and restore the recorded redirect bits when present. A single-arm plan confirmed
by a release that recorded only the per-interface bit gets `conf/all` turned
off by the runtime keeper after an upgrade; the keeper first saves the host's
value in the transaction directory, and rollback restores it from there. For IPv6 it
records the prior ShakerProxy radvd file, `net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding`, and a
kernel-managed WAN `accept_ra`, and on rollback stops `shakerproxy-radvd`, restores
those values, removes only ShakerProxy's IPv6 hooks and chains, and restores the
radvd file byte-for-byte. Outcomes are
strict, atomic, immutable (a rollback that succeeded replaces only a failed
attempt's `ROLLBACK_FAILED`), and bounded. The
transient watchdog grants only the required configuration and Netplan runtime paths
observed on Ubuntu's networkd renderer. At daemon startup, durable confirmation
or rollback outcomes are reconciled before any other recovery decision. An
unexpired transaction recreates only its derived watchdog unit while retaining
the original deadline; an expired transaction is rolled back synchronously
before the daemon serves. A transaction interrupted before its immutable
manifest was armed is closed without host mutation. If recovery cannot finish
(for example the lock is held, or the records disagree), gatewayd still
serves: status reports `network_recovery` in `degraded` with the reason,
emergency bypass and `network off` keep working, commits and turning bypass
off are refused, a confirmed plan's runtime state is not restored, and
recovery is retried every 15 seconds. A capture root with unsafe permissions
(`capture_unavailable`) or a traffic policy that does not load
(`traffic_policy`, lab traffic passes without it and it is retried) is
reported the same way instead of stopping the daemon. The watchdog takes the
configuration lock before it rolls back and then reads the confirmation and
outcome again, because the gateway confirms and rolls back under that lock; a
`ROLLBACK_FAILED` it recorded after giving up on the lock is superseded by the
gateway's own completed rollback. Release installation
remains gated on the remaining appliance acceptance work.

Before watchdog arming, the internal syntax gate atomically stages renderer
output under the daemon-generated transaction directory, runs only
`/usr/sbin/netplan generate --root-dir <derived-root>`,
`/usr/sbin/iptables-restore --test`, and—for managed-DHCP topologies—
`/usr/sbin/kea-dhcp4 -t /dev/stdin`, plus `ip6tables-restore --test` and
`/usr/sbin/radvd --configtest --config /dev/stdin` when the plan has IPv6
artifacts,
and persists SHA-256-bound evidence. It
uses a minimal fixed environment, bounded input/output, a shared timeout, and
does not allow `netplan apply` or firewall load arguments.

The apply primitive requires
an `APPLYING` lifecycle record, matching immutable watchdog manifest, an
apply-ready firewall observation, and persisted syntax-evidence hashes for the
exact Netplan and restore payloads. It atomically writes only the owned Netplan
file, generates before applying, enables IPv4 forwarding, loads dedicated
chains with `iptables-restore --noflush`, and attaches only exact ShakerProxy jumps.
It then loads the IPv6 chains with `ip6tables-restore --noflush`; for a routed
lab prefix it keeps WAN router advertisements (`accept_ra=2`) before enabling
IPv6 forwarding, writes the radvd file, and restarts `shakerproxy-radvd`. Other
plans stop `shakerproxy-radvd` and remove its file. DHCPv4 starts last.
It stops on the first failure so the coordinator can enter guarded rollback.

The internal coordinator now enforces the ordering boundary: persist
`PREPARING`, capture rollback state, validate syntax, durably write the
manifest, start the independent unit, persist `WATCHDOG_ARMED`, persist
`APPLYING`, mutate, persist apply completion, run all health checks, and only
then await confirmation. Every failure after watchdog arming uses a fresh
rollback context. Rollback failure leaves the watchdog armed for a later retry;
successful rollback records an immutable outcome before disarming. Confirmation
writes the durable hash/deadline marker before atomically entering
`ROUTED_PASSTHROUGH` and stopping the watchdog.

The health boundary now has a concrete, fail-closed host implementation. Five
required checks run concurrently: a second authenticated management channel,
WAN carrier/operational state plus the preserved default route, a fixed DNS
lookup for `example.com`, and IPv4 forwarding plus exact ShakerProxy chain and hook
presence, plus DHCPv4 service state and lab-link carrier/operational state.
Probe output is bounded and firewall inspection accepts only fixed argument
arrays. The IPv6 check verifies the drop chain for `DISABLED`, and forwarding,
the lab gateway address, a running `shakerproxy-radvd`, and the exact IPv6 chains
and hooks for a routed lab prefix. It is skipped only for `OBSERVE_ONLY` and
hosts whose kernel has no IPv6; a probe that cannot check IPv6 is a failure,
never an assumed success.

The second management channel uses a one-time, hash-bound token issued before
apply. Only its SHA-256 digest is retained in memory, signals are accepted only
for the exact apply ID and plan hash before the watchdog deadline, and retries
are idempotent. An API-daemon restart deliberately loses the channel and
therefore fails health closed; the independent watchdog remains the durable
recovery authority.

The privileged RPC exposes commit, heartbeat, and confirmation only when the
daemon starts with explicit network activation enabled and verifies root,
Ubuntu 24.04 or 26.04 amd64, a running systemd host, and every fixed executable. Commit
is asynchronous and idempotent in-process: it returns the derived heartbeat
capability before the host worker can wait on management health, and identical
retries cannot start a second apply. The HTTP boundary requires an authenticated
session, a fresh administrator password for commit and confirmation, and an
idempotency key. Passwords never enter privileged RPC parameters. The browser
sends the heartbeat through a separate authenticated request and must later
confirm explicitly. Development gateway containers do not enable these methods.

## NetworkManager hosts

ShakerProxy targets Ubuntu Server, where systemd-networkd manages the network.
Ubuntu Desktop uses NetworkManager instead, and every plan runs `netplan apply`,
which restarts NetworkManager and drops its interfaces for a few seconds. The
health checks then fail and the change rolls back. **Check this plan** therefore
refuses an interface that NetworkManager manages (`NETWORK_MANAGER_OWNS_INTERFACE`).

Use Ubuntu Server, or hand the selected ports to systemd-networkd first. For a
port `ens18` that gets its address by DHCP:

```bash
# 1. Let systemd-networkd render ens18. A per-device renderer is needed because
#    the desktop's /usr/lib/netplan/00-network-manager-all.yaml makes
#    NetworkManager the default.
sudo tee /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml >/dev/null <<'YAML'
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens18:
      renderer: networkd
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp-identifier: mac
YAML
sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
# 2. Tell NetworkManager to leave ens18 alone.
printf '[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=interface-name:ens18\n' | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/99-shakerproxy-unmanaged.conf >/dev/null
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd
sudo netplan apply && sudo nmcli general reload conf
networkctl list ens18    # SETUP must say "configured"
```

Keep a console open while you do this. `dhcp-identifier: mac` keeps the DHCP
address the port had under NetworkManager.

ShakerProxy itself runs Netplan through two fixed units,
`shakerproxy-netplan-generate.service` and `shakerproxy-netplan-apply.service`,
so Netplan has the privileges it has at boot while the gateway daemon keeps only
`CAP_NET_ADMIN`.

## Turning the lab off

A confirmed plan stays in force until you turn the lab network off: **Turn off
lab network** at the top of the Network page (asks for the administrator
password), `POST /api/v1/network/active/revert`, or `sudo shakerproxy network
off`. All three call the same gateway method. It takes
the network configuration lock and restores the running plan's retained
pre-apply snapshot with the watchdog's rollback executor (Netplan, Kea,
hostapd, radvd, the ShakerProxy firewall chains, forwarding and redirects),
then returns the gateway to setup mode. Netplan never deletes a bridge or VLAN
that leaves its configuration, and networkd can keep a lab address, so the
snapshot also records which of the plan's bridges (`spbr0`, `lgbr0`), VLAN
subinterfaces and lab addresses the host did not have before it was applied.
The rollback (also the watchdog's) deletes exactly those: the links before
Netplan applies the restored configuration, so freed ports get theirs, the
addresses after it. The links go only once the restored configuration has
generated: if it does not, they stay, so the host keeps the address a bridge
may hold, and the restore is reported as failed. If applying it fails after
the links are gone, the rollback applies it once more. It then checks that
none is left and reports any that is as a failed restore. A bridge, VLAN or
address the host already had is never touched. Plans confirmed by an earlier
release have no such record, and their rollback removes no links. If the
restore fails, emergency bypass is enabled so lab traffic fails open;
ShakerProxy keeps answering DNS sent to its lab address while the plan is
still on record. Only one plan can be active: staging a new candidate never
replaces the running plan, and a new plan can be applied after
`network off`.

The same action retries an undo that did not finish. When a change's rollback
failed (`ROLLBACK_FAILED`, emergency bypass on) or was interrupted, `network
off` first runs that change's own rollback again, from its own snapshot, and on
success records it as rolled back and leaves setup mode with bypass off; on
failure bypass stays on and the watchdog keeps any retry of its own. A plan
that was turned off is marked so in its transaction directory
(`reverted.json`), and its snapshot is never restored a second time: with
emergency bypass turned on in setup mode, `network off` reports that nothing is
running instead of replaying an old snapshot.

A commit waits up to 15 seconds for the configuration lock (a capture, a
policy change or the runtime check may hold it), and status reports it as
`ACCEPTED` meanwhile. A commit that still cannot take the lock changes nothing
and can simply be applied again. SSH sessions opened or closed since staging do
not require staging again: the commit re-validates the plan against every
current session and refuses only if a reviewed SSH path now reaches the host on
a different interface.

## After a reboot

Netplan, Kea, hostapd, and radvd keep their confirmed configuration across a
reboot, and startup recovery re-enables those services. Forwarding and the
ShakerProxy firewall are kernel runtime state that a reboot erases:
`net.ipv4.ip_forward`, the single-arm `send_redirects` bits, IPv6 forwarding,
the WAN `accept_ra=2` setting, and the ShakerProxy iptables/ip6tables chains,
hooks, and NAT.

When gatewayd starts with a confirmed plan in routed or emergency-bypass mode,
it re-establishes that state with the apply path's fixed commands. It first
proves the stored preview is still bound to the confirmed plan: the plan hashes
to its confirmed hash, and the preview, durable confirmation, watchdog
manifest, and native syntax evidence all name that hash and the exact firewall
batches. Any mismatch is logged and nothing is loaded. For each address family
it then reloads ShakerProxy's chains (a restore that flushes and refills only
ShakerProxy-owned chains), inserts missing hooks, turns single-arm redirects
off, and only then turns forwarding back on. Until that succeeds, the host keeps its boot defaults, so the lab has
no forwarding and fails closed. A missing hook is inserted directly below the
traffic-policy hook when that hook exists, so per-device blocks and
encrypted-DNS drops keep running before ShakerProxy's accept rules.

The same component checks every 30 seconds, using read-only commands, that the
ShakerProxy chains have their expected rule counts, that the hooks exist (for
example after Docker creates `DOCKER-USER` late or an administrator flushes a
table), that the forwarding sysctls are set, and for single-arm that both
`send_redirects` values are off. It restores whatever is
missing and logs what drifted. It skips a pass while another configuration
change holds the appliance lock and does nothing in `SETUP_SAFE` mode.
Restoring is idempotent, so it also runs on every gatewayd restart. The
traffic-policy chains (DNS/TLS redirects) are re-applied by their own
reconciliation loop.

## Clean-VM evidence

The pinned Ubuntu 24.04 amd64 QEMU fixture installs the reproducible development
package and an offline Ubuntu Docker package closure. It has passed explicit
confirm, absent-confirmation timeout, gateway-daemon `SIGKILL`, and abrupt host
reboot during the confirmation window. Those runs cover native syntax checks,
real Netplan and iptables mutation, original-deadline watchdog recreation,
durable outcome reconciliation, idempotent rollback when reboot has already
cleared transient firewall state, forwarding restoration, and a real Docker
restart without duplicate ShakerProxy hooks. A fifth host-safety scenario opens an
established OpenSSH connection on the WAN address, records its source,
destination, effective configured port, and interface, rejects assigning that
interface to the lab role, and retains the same socket through apply. It then
stops Docker service and socket and proves local CLI bypass preserves the simple
forwarding/NAT path and returns to confirmed routing when disabled.

The DHCP scenario adds a veth-backed client namespace, obtains and persists a
real Kea lease, verifies the advertised route, and completes a TCP round trip
through ShakerProxy NAT to a deterministic upstream endpoint. Timeout and reboot
also verify that the DHCP unit is disabled and Ubuntu's prior Kea file is
restored byte-for-byte.

These include an isolated Linux namespace proof for the single-arm forwarding,
NAT, and redirect behavior, but not a clean-VM Ubuntu lifecycle certification.
Static WAN, VLAN trunk, three-interface, passive sensor, single-arm host
lifecycle, cloud-init override, and MTU behavior still require native Ubuntu
24.04/26.04 apply, connectivity, reboot, and rollback acceptance runs. The
wider topology, upgrade, rollback, and appliance acceptance matrix remains
required.
