# One-line installation trust chain

ShakerProxy's convenience installation path is designed to reduce the amount of
code executed directly from the bootstrap URL. A stable GitHub release contains
`bootstrap.sh`, the release manifest and signature, the pinned public key, the
full installer, the host Debian package, and the Compose bundle.

After a **stable release is actually published**, the convenience form is:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL \
  https://github.com/andriyze/ShakerProxy-releases/releases/latest/download/bootstrap.sh \
  | sudo bash
```

To check the host first without changing anything, pass installer options
after `-s --`; the bootstrap forwards them to the verified installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL \
  https://github.com/andriyze/ShakerProxy-releases/releases/latest/download/bootstrap.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --dry-run
```

The friendlier front door, [`install/index.sh`](../install/index.sh), runs
as a regular user, checks the machine, picks the newest release of the
channel (the installed release's, else stable, else the newest beta while no
stable release is published) from GitHub's release list, downloads that
release's `bootstrap.sh` to a temporary file and runs it with sudo:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andriyze/ShakerProxy-releases/main/install/index.sh | sh
```

It makes no trust decisions of its own; everything below still applies. The
release list only selects a version, which the bootstrap then requires the
signed manifest to match. A
branded short URL may serve it through
[`install/cloudflare-worker.js`](../install/cloudflare-worker.js), which reads
`index.sh` from the latest release's tag rather than `main` and never generates
installation commands or release metadata dynamically.

## Trust sequence

`bootstrap.sh` performs this sequence before executing the larger installer:

1. Require root and a supported HTTPS GitHub release location.
2. Fetch `manifest.json`, `manifest.json.sig`, and `release-public.pem`.
3. Calculate the public key fingerprint and compare it with the fingerprint
   compiled into the bootstrap.
4. Verify the release-manifest signature.
5. Read the full installer URL and SHA-256 only from the signed manifest.
6. Require the installer URL to remain under this repository's immutable
   versioned GitHub release path.
7. Download `install.sh`.
8. Verify its SHA-256 against the signed manifest.
9. Execute the verified installer.
10. The installer independently re-verifies release identity, signed manifest,
    host package, Compose bundle, and immutable image digests before mutation.

The signed release builder and schema require installer metadata:

```json
{
  "installer": {
    "url": "https://github.com/andriyze/ShakerProxy-releases/releases/download/v1.0.0/install.sh",
    "sha256": "..."
  }
}
```

The release workflow publishes `bootstrap.sh` together with the other release
assets. `tests/packaging/release-bundle-smoke.sh` verifies that the installer
checksum is bound into the signed manifest.

## Limitation of every curl-to-shell bootstrap

The first bootstrap bytes are trusted through the URL/TLS distribution path.
No shell script can cryptographically authenticate itself using a key contained
only inside that same potentially replaced script. Administrators requiring a
stronger first-hop trust model should download `bootstrap.sh` and the committed
release public key through separate trusted paths, review the script, verify
the expected key fingerprint, and then execute it locally.

Do not describe `curl | sudo bash` as eliminating first-hop transport trust.
The signed chain starts by pinning the release key inside the bootstrap and then
protects every larger artifact that follows.

## Safe installation state

Successful package installation does **not** make the machine a gateway. The
installer starts ShakerProxy in `SETUP_SAFE`; network forwarding, DHCP, DNS
enforcement, packet capture, and TLS interception require explicit onboarding,
preview, staged application, watchdog health checks, and confirmation.

For now, the supported routed profile is IPv4-only.
Before attaching client devices, run:

```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/shakerproxy/shakerproxy-mvp-preflight \
  --test-interface <lab-interface>
```

Do not proceed if it reports `"supported": false`. Full routed IPv6 remains a
separate release gate.
