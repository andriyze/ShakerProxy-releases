# Documentation map

ShakerProxy is pre-alpha. The [capability registry](../schemas/feature-flags.yaml)
and the [platform support matrix](../schemas/support-matrix.yaml) define what the
project currently claims; [capability claims](capabilities.md) explains how to
read them. Design prose and passing source tests do not promote a capability
beyond those records.

## Start here

- [Device testing quick start](device-testing-quickstart.md) walks through
  choosing how a device reaches ShakerProxy, decrypting its HTTPS or testing
  certificate validation, blocking its internet or a domain, and reading its
  report.
- How devices reach ShakerProxy, easiest first: [VPN mode](vpn-mode.md)
  (phones and laptops, any network), [inline bridge](bridge-mode.md) (wired
  TVs and IoT, no device setup), [Wi-Fi access point](wifi-access-point.md),
  a lab port ([networking](networking.md)) and
  [same network (single-arm)](single-arm.md).
- [One-line installation trust chain](one-line-install.md) explains what the
  installer verifies before it changes anything.
- [Development quick start](quick-start.md) covers the non-routing local stack
  and the `make dev-demo` demo lab.
- [Installation and release lifecycle](installation.md) separates the current
  source workflow from the not-yet-published signed installer.
- [AI agent quick connect](ai-agent-quick-connect.md) is the three-step path for
  creating a read-only token, saving it securely on the sensor, verifying the
  connection, and generating local or SSH MCP client configuration.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) explains the privileged host/application
  boundary.
- [Capability claims](capabilities.md) defines feature status and platform
  certification language.
- [Protocol support](protocol-support.md) shows what ShakerProxy records, names,
  shows live and can read for each protocol, in each way a device can reach it.
- [Threat model](threat-model.md) records the security assumptions and
  non-goals.

Architecture decisions live under [`docs/adr`](adr/). Executable and retained
test descriptions live under [`docs/testing`](testing/); the Ubuntu 26.04
shared-VPS boundary is recorded in
[UBU2604-001](testing/evidence/foundation/UBU2604-001/README.md). Run
`make docs-check` for the fast documentation-only validation or `make verify`
for the complete portable repository gate.
