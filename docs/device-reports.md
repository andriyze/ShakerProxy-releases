# Device reports, findings, and test runs

ShakerProxy answers the questions a smart-device tester asks:

- **What does this device talk to?** Domains with the company behind them and
  what kind of service they are (analytics, advertising, telemetry, …).
- **Is it secure?** Evidence-backed findings with a plain explanation and a fix.
- **What changed between firmware 1.2 and 1.3?** Two test runs compared.

Everything here works from the Web UI, the API, the CLI (`shakerproxy report`,
`shakerproxy test`, `shakerproxy compare`), and AI agents through MCP
(`device_report`, `compare_runs`, `test_sessions`; see
[MCP agent integration](mcp-agent-integration.md)).

## 1. Refer to a device any way you like

Every device argument accepts a **friendly name**, an **IP address**, a **MAC
address**, or the **device ID**:

```text
Living room TV        living-room-tv       10.77.0.23
52:54:00:AA:BB:23     52-54-00-aa-bb-23    5254.00aa.bb23
device-0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

Resolution order: exact device ID → exact MAC (any case or separator) → exact
current IP (then the most recent device that held it) → exact name
(case-insensitive; spaces, hyphens, underscores, and dots are treated alike;
DHCP hostnames count as names) → name prefix → name substring. The first level
that matches wins. If it matches more than one device you get the candidates;
if it matches none, you are told how to list devices.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/devices/resolve?q=tv"
```

```json
{"schema":1,"query":"tv","unique":true,
 "matches":[{"device_id":"device-…","friendly_name":"Living room TV","vendor":"Samsung",
   "addresses":["10.77.0.23"],"hardware_addresses":["52:54:00:aa:bb:23"],
   "online":true,"match":"name_contains"}]}
```

Endpoints that take a device in the path return
`404 device_not_found` ("No device matches "x". Run `shakerproxy devices` or open
Devices …") or `409 device_ambiguous` with `error.candidates`.

Scope: administrator session or `devices:read`.

## 2. Test sessions

A test session is a named, time-bounded run against one device, for example
"Firmware 2.1 first boot". Reports and comparisons use its time range.

```bash
# Start (default name: "<device name> — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM", UTC)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SESSION" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device":"Living room TV","name":"Firmware 2.1 first boot","capture":true}' \
  https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/test-sessions

# Stop
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SESSION" \
  https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/test-sessions/ts-0123456789abcdef01234567/stop
```

- One **running** session per device: starting another stops the previous one
  (the response says so in `warnings`).
- `capture: true` also starts a bounded packet capture through the normal
  capture path (default ring and a one-hour stop deadline) and links it
  (`capture_session_id`). It records whole packets, so the file shows domains
  and TLS server names, unless `headers_only: true` asks for the first 256
  bytes of each packet (`full_capture: true` is accepted for whole packets).
  Lab traffic is recorded automatically anyway (see
  [automatic lab recording](capture-and-storage.md#automatic-lab-recording));
  a session's capture runs beside that recording, so Traffic stays live, and
  links the packets to the session. If capture is not available the
  session still starts and `warnings` explains why. Stopping the session stops
  its capture.
- `GET /api/v1/test-sessions?device=<ref>&state=RUNNING|STOPPED&limit=50`,
  `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/test-sessions/{id}` (`PATCH` takes `name` and
  `notes`; `DELETE` removes only the session record, never traffic or
  packets, and stops the capture of a running session).
- Stored in `test-sessions.json` in the control API data directory, written
  atomically, at most 2000 sessions (the oldest stopped sessions are pruned).

Scopes: reading needs `devices:read`; starting, changing, stopping, and
deleting need an administrator session or an API token with `lab:write`.
There is no password prompt.

## 3. The device report

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/devices/Living%20room%20TV/report?window=24h"
```

Choose the time range with one of:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `session=ts-…` | The test session's start to end (or now, while running). |
| `window=15m\|1h\|6h\|24h\|7d\|30d` | The last window. |
| `start=…&end=…` | RFC 3339 range, at most 31 days. |
| *(none)* | The device's running test session, otherwise the last 24 hours. |

The report contains:

- `summary`: one plain sentence, for example *"Living room TV contacted 42
  domains using 5 protocols (TLS, DNS, MQTT); 3 findings (1 high, 1 medium,
  1 info)."*
- `device`, `window_start`, `window_end`, `session` (or `null`), `ca_trust`.
- `totals`: events, flows, bytes, DNS queries, TLS connections, HTTP requests,
  alerts. When Zeek and Suricata both see a connection it is counted once.
- `domains`: every name seen in DNS lookups (ShakerProxy's DNS forwarder records
  these without a capture), TLS server names, and HTTP hosts,
  with the registrable domain, the organization, a category (`analytics`,
  `advertising`, `crash-reporting`, `telemetry`, `cloud-platform`, `cdn`,
  `push`, `os-services`, `streaming`, `iot-cloud`, `unknown`), sources, event
  counts, first and last seen. Local names (`.local`, `.arpa`) are left out.
  The organization and category come from ShakerProxy's own curated table of well
  known services (for example `samsungacr.com` → Samsung, telemetry).
- `protocols`: application protocols identified from Zeek/Suricata analyzer
  results and well-known ports, with how visible each is (`DECRYPTED`,
  `CLEARTEXT`, `ENCRYPTED_METADATA`, `OPAQUE`, or `UNKNOWN` when the protocol
  picks its security per connection, as OPC UA and STARTTLS do, and none was
  observed), how it was identified (`ANALYZER`, the only payload-confirmed
  level; `CARRIER_AND_PORT` when an analyzer confirmed only the TLS, QUIC, DNS
  or HTTP carrier and the port named the application, such as TLS on TCP 853
  read as DNS over TLS; or `PORT_HEURISTIC`), and whether it is unusual
  (`exotic`). `decrypted_flows` and `decrypted_bytes` count the connections
  ShakerProxy decrypted. Each passive connection record is matched to an
  interception of that same connection (client and server address and port,
  transport, within ten minutes) before it is grouped, so decrypting one HTTPS
  server never marks another server on TCP 443 as decrypted. `visibility` is
  `DECRYPTED` only when every connection was; otherwise it describes the
  connections that were not, and `flows - decrypted_flows` says how many.
  An OPC UA connection record is matched the same way to the OPC UA secure
  channel record of that connection ([industrial protocols](industrial-protocols.md)):
  security mode None or Sign makes it `CLEARTEXT`, SignAndEncrypt
  `ENCRYPTED_METADATA`, and without one it stays `UNKNOWN`.
  See [protocol discovery](protocol-discovery.md) for the evidence levels.
- `tls`: decrypted, passed-through, and failed HTTPS connections, likely
  pinning, failed and decrypted hosts, and legacy versions (SSL, TLS 1.0/1.1)
  per host.
- `http`: requests, hosts, unencrypted requests, and status classes.
- `findings` (see below) and `truncated`.

Scope: administrator session, or an API token with **both** `devices:read` and
`traffic:read`.

## 4. Findings

Findings are raised only from observed evidence. Each has a stable `id`, a
`severity`, a plain `title`, a `detail` that says why it matters, a
`recommendation`, and up to ten `evidence` lines (plus "…and N more").

| ID | Severity | Raised when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accepts-untrusted-certificates` | CRITICAL | CA trust is `NOT_INSTALLED` and ShakerProxy still decrypted at least one HTTPS connection: the device does not validate certificates. |
| `cleartext-http` | MEDIUM (LOW if only local hosts) | HTTP requests were seen without encryption (Zeek/Suricata HTTP logs or interceptor), or an analyzer identified HTTP. A port-80 guess alone is not enough. |
| `insecure-remote-access` | HIGH (MEDIUM if identified by port only and only outbound) | Telnet, FTP, TFTP, or VNC, in either direction. When other hosts connected to the device, the title says the device *accepts* these connections. |
| `exposed-services` | INFO | Ports other hosts connected to on the device, including connections from other lab devices, so you can see what the device listens on. |
| `outdated-tls` | MEDIUM (HIGH for SSL) | Zeek or Suricata saw an SSL, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1 handshake. |
| `encrypted-dns-bypass` | MEDIUM | DNS over HTTPS was detected, or DNS over TLS/QUIC connections were seen. |
| `vpn-or-tunnel` | MEDIUM (LOW if identified by port only) | WireGuard, OpenVPN, IPsec, Tailscale, PPTP, GRE, Tor, SOCKS, or IPv6/overlay tunnels. |
| `opaque-traffic` | LOW | More than 25% of at least 64 KB of traffic used protocols ShakerProxy cannot identify or see into. |
| `certificate-pinning` | INFO | HTTPS decryption failed with the exact reasons `probable_certificate_pinning_or_custom_trust_store` or `dynamic_probable_pinning_bypass`. The generic `ca_not_trusted_or_pinning` reason is not treated as pinning. |
| `exotic-protocols` | INFO | Unusual protocols (for example MQTT, CoAP, Modbus) were identified; each is listed. |
| `alerts` | highest alert severity | Suricata alerts or ShakerProxy detections matched the device's traffic. |

Findings are sorted by severity. Protocol findings say whether the protocol
was identified by protocol analysis or by port number only.

## 5. CA trust

Whether a decrypted HTTPS connection is expected or a vulnerability depends on
whether the ShakerProxy CA is installed on the device. Record it once per device:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $SESSION" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state":"NOT_INSTALLED"}' \
  https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/devices/10.77.0.23/ca-trust
```

```json
{"schema":1,"device_id":"device-…","ca_trust":"NOT_INSTALLED","updated_at":"2026-09-29T10:00:00Z"}
```

States are `INSTALLED`, `NOT_INSTALLED`, and `UNKNOWN` (the default). Each
change is written to the device audit log as `DEVICE_CA_TRUST_UPDATED`; setting
the current state again is a no-op. Scope: administrator session or `lab:write`;
no password prompt. While the state is `UNKNOWN` and HTTPS was
decrypted, the report summary reminds you to record it. The device JSON
carries `ca_trust` only when it is set.

## 6. Compare two runs

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/devices/tv/compare?base=ts-…&compare=ts-…"
```

Each side is a test session (`base`, `compare`) or an RFC 3339 range
(`base_start`/`base_end`, `compare_start`/`compare_end`). The result:

```json
{"schema":1,"generated_at":"…","device_id":"device-…",
 "summary":"Compared with Firmware 1.2, Firmware 1.3: 3 domains added, 1 domain removed; new protocols: mqtt; new finding (MEDIUM): Device sends unencrypted HTTP.",
 "base":{"start":"…","end":"…","session_id":"ts-…","name":"Firmware 1.2","totals":{…}},
 "compare":{…},
 "domains":{"added":["…"],"removed":["…"]},
 "protocols":{"added":["mqtt"],"removed":[]},
 "findings":{"new":[finding…],"resolved":[finding…]},
 "tls":{"newly_failed_hosts":["…"],"newly_intercepted_hosts":["…"]},
 "truncated":false}
```

`truncated` is true when either run reached a list bound (500 domains, 50
failed or decrypted hosts); some added or removed items may then only reflect
ranking, and the summary says so.

## 7. How it works and its limits

- The report is computed on request from a read-only, bounded aggregation of
  the device's stored events (ingestd `GET /v1/device-activity`, at most 31
  days). Nothing is precomputed or stored.
- Protocols are classified with the shared protocol catalog from Zeek service
  names, Suricata `app_proto`, and well-known ports.
- The domain table is first-party and curated from public knowledge; unknown
  domains are reported as `unknown`, not guessed.
- Traffic ShakerProxy did not see (for example DNS over HTTPS to an unknown
  resolver without interception) cannot appear in a report.
- Bounds: 500 domains, 256 protocols, 50 failed/decrypted hosts, 20 hosts per
  legacy TLS version, 10 evidence lines per finding; `truncated` is set when a
  bound was reached.

## 8. JSON additions beyond the shared contract

These fields are additive and backward compatible: `summary` on reports and
comparisons, `protocols` and `tls.intercepted_hosts` on reports,
`schema`/`generated_at`/`truncated` on comparisons, `name` on comparison sides, and
`warnings` on test-session start/stop responses. Test-session lists are
returned as `{"schema":1,"sessions":[…],"total":N,"truncated":false}`.
