# Virtual Test Lab

Status: **experimental public-beta self-test**.

The Virtual Test Lab creates disposable Linux network namespaces on the ShakerProxy
Ubuntu host so an operator can exercise client-side networking before connecting
a physical phone or Smart TV. It is deliberately separate from the production
packet path and never claims that a synthetic Linux client certifies Android,
iOS, Wi-Fi, or Smart TV behavior.

## Safety model

The privileged host component is `/usr/libexec/shakerproxy/shakerproxy-testlabd`.
It exposes only a local Unix socket at:

```text
/var/lib/shakerproxy/control-api/testlab/testlab.sock
```

The socket is root-owned and group-readable/writable only by the control-api
runtime identity. The service has no TCP listener and no Docker socket access.
The browser can reach it only through authenticated control-api endpoints.
Running or forcing cleanup requires fresh administrator-password verification.

The service owns only names beginning with `lgtest-` and the dedicated nftables
table `inet shakerproxy-testlab`. Every run removes those objects before setup and
again on completion. The original `net.ipv4.ip_forward` value is restored after
the run.

The service does **not** modify ShakerProxy's authoritative traffic-policy document
or create fake DNS/TLS/analyzer events merely to make a self-test pass.

## Virtual topology

```text
normal client 198.18.240.10 ---\
bypass client 198.18.240.20 ----+-- lgtest-client 198.18.240.1
DNS client    198.18.240.30 ---/            |
                                             | host IPv4 forwarding
                                             |
                                  lgtest-wan 198.18.241.1
                                             |
                                   target 198.18.241.254
```

The `198.18.0.0/15` range is reserved for benchmark/testing use and is not used
as a normal Internet destination.

The [visibility coverage check](visibility-coverage.md) adds IPv6 to the same
lab from the unique-local prefix `fd8a:6c1e:4b37::/48`:

```text
clients fd8a:6c1e:4b37:f0::10/20/30 --- lgtest-client  fd8a:6c1e:4b37:f0::1 (DNS only)
                                             |
                                lgtest-router  f0::2 / f1::1 (IPv6 forwarding in its own namespace)
                                             |
                                lgtest-wan --- target fd8a:6c1e:4b37:f1::fe
```

IPv6 is routed by the `lgtest-router` namespace, not by the host. Turning on any
`net.ipv6.conf.*.forwarding` on the host makes Linux drop every IPv6 default
route it learned from router advertisements, so the check never changes the
host's IPv6 forwarding and has nothing to restore.

The target namespace is implemented by the same signed ShakerProxy binary and
provides bounded local HTTP, UDP DNS, and TLS endpoints. No third-party test
container is required.

## UI profiles

### Quick

Runs:

- namespace/bridge creation;
- independent virtual client addressing;
- routed IPv4 HTTP from a client network to the target network.

Use this immediately after install to detect basic namespace, bridge, routing,
or host-firewall conflicts.

### DNS

Runs:

- UDP DNS transaction to the deterministic target;
- a dedicated test-lab TCP/853 drop mechanic.

The TCP/853 drop is explicitly labeled a **mechanic proof**, not a ShakerProxy
DoT-policy proof. The UI returns `SKIP` for encrypted-DNS product proof until
the normal ShakerProxy traffic-policy/event path observes a real DoH/DoT/DoQ test.

### TLS

Checks whether interception prerequisites exist, but deliberately does not
force traffic into mitmproxy behind the traffic-policy owner's back.

TLS interception and probable-pinning tests remain `SKIP` unless they are
performed through the normal per-client traffic policy with real event evidence.
This prevents a self-test from claiming decryption or pinning behavior that the
actual product path did not observe.

### Full

Runs every virtual profile and additionally reports the external evidence gates
for:

- PCAP -> Zeek/Suricata -> normalized events -> Traffic search;
- MCP queries using a separately scoped token;
- TLS interception and pinned/custom-trust recovery;
- physical Android/iOS/Smart TV validation.

These remain `SKIP` until their real subsystem produces evidence.

## Combining Test Lab with a normal capture

To prove the analyzer path without synthetic events:

1. Open **Captures** and start a normal bounded capture.
2. Open **Test Lab** and run `Quick`, `DNS`, or `Full`.
3. Stop/finalize the capture.
4. Open **Traffic** and filter the resulting RFC 2544 addresses, for example:

```text
src.ip:198.18.240.10
src.ip:198.18.240.30 AND service:dns
```

5. Confirm the traffic came through the real capture/analyzer/ingest pipeline.
6. Export the filtered metadata or finalized PCAP through the existing export
   workflows.

The Test Lab service itself never inserts rows into PostgreSQL.

## PASS / FAIL / SKIP semantics

- **PASS** — the named command/protocol check really succeeded.
- **FAIL** — the named check ran and produced an unexpected result.
- **SKIP** — ShakerProxy intentionally does not have enough evidence to make that
  claim from the virtual environment.

`SKIP` is not a warning-colored PASS. It is an explicit remaining evidence gate.

## Physical beta testing remains mandatory

Before a beta build is promoted beyond internal testing, run
`docs/testing/mvp-physical-client-acceptance.md` with at least:

- Android;
- iOS/iPadOS;
- Android/Google TV;
- another representative Smart TV platform when available;
- a desktop browser control client.

The Virtual Test Lab complements those tests; it does not replace them.
