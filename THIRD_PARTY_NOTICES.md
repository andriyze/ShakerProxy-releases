# Third-party software and data

ShakerProxy stands on the work of many open-source networking and security projects. This file
credits the engines, system tools, libraries and data sets that ShakerProxy bundles in its container
images, compiles into its binaries, relies on from the host operating system, or contacts at
runtime, together with their authors and licences.

Each component remains under its own licence. Nothing here changes those terms, and ShakerProxy's own
[AGPL-3.0-only licence](LICENSE) does not apply to them. Where a licence requires it, the full
licence text ships with the component: inside container images (for Debian and Alpine packages
under `/usr/share/doc/<package>/copyright` or `/usr/share/licenses`, for Python packages in their
`*.dist-info` directory), in the Ubuntu packages the host installs, and for Go modules in the
module source recorded by `go.sum`. Release images are built with SBOM and provenance attestations
(`docker buildx build --sbom=true --provenance=mode=max` in `packaging/build-push-images.sh`).

To obtain the corresponding source for a GPL- or LGPL-licensed component in a published image,
use the upstream URL and the exact version or image digest pinned in `versions.lock.yaml` and the
Dockerfiles listed below, or open an issue and we will provide it.

## Host software (Ubuntu packages the installer depends on)

These are installed from Ubuntu's archive by the `shakerproxy-host` package (Depends/Recommends) and
invoked at runtime; ShakerProxy does not redistribute them.

## Go libraries compiled into ShakerProxy binaries

Exactly the modules below are linked into the shipped binaries (`go list -deps ./apps/... ./host/...`);
versions are pinned in `go.mod` and `go.sum`. The Go standard library (BSD-3-Clause, The Go
Authors) is statically linked into every binary.

| Module | Author / maintainer | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| github.com/jackc/pgx/v5 v5.10.0, pgpassfile, pgservicefile, puddle/v2 | Jack Christensen | MIT |
| github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk v1.7.0 | Model Context Protocol contributors | MIT, transitioning to Apache-2.0 (non-specification documentation CC-BY-4.0); the upstream `LICENSE` is preserved as published |
| github.com/google/jsonschema-go v0.4.3 | JSON Schema Go Project Authors | MIT |
| github.com/segmentio/asm v1.1.3, github.com/segmentio/encoding v0.5.4 | Segment | MIT |

| golang.org/x/crypto, net, oauth2, sync, sys, text, time | The Go Authors | BSD-3-Clause |

## Web UI libraries

Only these packages are included in the shipped web UI bundle (`apps/web-ui/package-lock.json`):

| Package | Author / maintainer | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| react 19.2.8, react-dom 19.2.8, scheduler 0.27.0 | Meta Platforms, Inc. and contributors | MIT |

The UI is built with Vite, `@vitejs/plugin-react` and TypeScript. Build-time packages are not
shipped; their licences are MIT, Apache-2.0 (TypeScript), ISC (picocolors), BSD-3-Clause
(source-map-js) and MPL-2.0 (lightningcss). The UI loads no fonts, scripts or styles from
third-party servers.

## Data sets

| Data | Author / maintainer | Upstream | Licence / terms | How ShakerProxy uses it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Public Suffix List | Mozilla Foundation and contributors | https://publicsuffix.org | MPL-2.0 | Embedded through `golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix`; groups domains by registrable domain in device reports |
| IEEE MA-L / MA-M / MA-S registries | IEEE Registration Authority | https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/regauth/ | IEEE terms, via Ubuntu's `ieee-data` package | Read at runtime on the host; the files in `testdata/ieee` are documentation-only fixtures |
| DoH resolver catalog (`apps/mitmproxy/resolvers.json`) | ShakerProxy contributors | This repository | AGPL-3.0-only | Lists public DNS-over-HTTPS hostnames (factual data) for encrypted-DNS detection |
| Domain ownership and category table (`internal/domainclass`) | ShakerProxy contributors | This repository | AGPL-3.0-only | Curated from public facts; not derived from third-party block lists |
| Protocol catalog (`internal/protocolclass`) | ShakerProxy contributors | This repository | AGPL-3.0-only | Protocol names, categories and well-known ports |
| ShakerProxy cleartext Suricata ruleset | ShakerProxy contributors | `apps/analyzer-worker/suricata.rules` | AGPL-3.0-only | Narrow first-party ruleset; not a third-party IDS feed |

## External services

ShakerProxy sends no telemetry and needs no account. It contacts other systems only in these cases:

- **Installation and updates** download the signed release, host package and container images
  from GitHub Releases and the GitHub Container Registry, and Ubuntu packages from the configured
  apt mirrors. The PostgreSQL image is pulled from Docker Hub by digest.
- **Connectivity probe:** `shakerproxy probe-connectivity` and the dashboard's probe button connect to Cloudflare's
  `1.1.1.1` on TCP/443 and TCP/53 without sending a DNS question. Nothing else is sent.
- **DNS forwarding** sends lab devices' queries to the upstream resolvers the administrator
  configures.
- **Cloud connector** (optional) stays idle and connects nowhere until an administrator
  enrols the appliance. Only then does it talk to a control plane, uploading only bounded
  metadata (device inventory, protocol summaries and event metadata). Raw packets, decrypted
  content and private keys stay on the appliance.
- **AI agents** reach ShakerProxy only through the local MCP server with a token an administrator
  creates; ShakerProxy itself does not call any AI provider.

If you believe a component is missing or mis-attributed, please open an issue.
